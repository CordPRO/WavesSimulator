Improvement on _**Dynamic Vertex Buffers: Waves Demo**_ by http://richardssoftware.net/. 

Ripples/Waves Simulation using Microsoft Direct Compute
--------------------------------------------------------
Vertex Calculation code is modified to utilize **Microsoft Direct Compute** resulting significant improvements in Performance. 

Reflective and Refractive Water Shader
----------------------------------------
Shaders involving **Reflection** and **Refraction** are also introduced to Water Surface with **Depth Based Blending.**

Sharp DX API
----------------------------------------
This code is based on **SharpDX (Version 3.0)**, which is a .Net based wrapper on **Microsoft Direct X 11** API.
The original code by *richardssoftware.net* utilizes **SlimDX** Wrapper. But I have used **SharpDX** instead of **SlimDX** since **SlimDX** has not received any updates recently. 

Special Thanks
