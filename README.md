Improvement on Dynamic Vertex Buffers: Waves Demo by http://richardssoftware.net/. Vertex Calculation code is modified to utilize Microsoft Direct Compute resulting significant improvements in Performance. Shaders involving Reflection and Refraction are also introduced to Water Surface with Depth Based Blending.

This code is based on SharpDX (Version 3.0), which is a .Net based wrapper on Microsoft Direct X 11 API.
The original code by richardssoftware.net utilizes SlimDX Wrapper. But I have used SharpDX instead of SlimDX since SlimDX has not received any updates from the author recently. 

Special Thanks
